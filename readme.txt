Instructions for executeables
  ./bin/test.exe -> This was my testing program to develop my various functions to transform the image and find regions. Not terribly relevant, but I included the code. Relies on provided test data
  ./bin/collect.exe -> Primary Executeable. No CL parameters necessary. I added command line parameters for when I was gathering my images for the report or test data. 
                       But you really only need to just execute as shown here. For ease of use, I included my data base as well. Also, I used an external webcam.
